Given an N*N matrix. Print the elements of the matrix in anticlockwise order (see the sample for better understanding).

Input-----
First line contains N.
N lines follow each containing N space seperated integers.

Constraints:-
2 <= N <= 500
1 <= Mat[i][j] <= 1000
Output-------
Output N*N integers in a single line separated by spaces, which are the elements of the matrix in anti-clockwise order.
